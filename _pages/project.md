## Project: [BRACU-ResearcherHub](https://github.com/nazrulhuda/BRACU-ResearcherHub)

Social media for BRAC University researchers to find collaborators. Researchers can create separate research labs within specific research areas. If other researchers find the lab interesting; they can join and comment on the lab. An efficient way to find the next research collaborator.

Link for [Github Code](https://github.com/nazrulhuda/BRACU-ResearcherHub), [Live Demo](https://bracuresearcherhub.onrender.com/) (might take a minute to load, as I am using free version of render)

Used tools: Django · Django REST Framework · PostgreSQL · SQLite


## Project: [Devising a Faster Video Streaming Architecture using Low Bandwidth Video Compression Techniques](https://github.com/nazrulhuda/video-codec-for-live-streaming)

This project is a part of the Research Proposal. Compared different codecs for live video streaming.

- Used FFmeg’s libx264 for H.264, libx265 for H.265, and libvpx-vp9 for VP9. To compare qualities, used SSIM, PSNR,
and VMAF. 
- Tuned the settings in real-time functionality to imitate live video streaming.This project is a part of the Research Proposal. Compared different codecs for live video streaming.

## Project: Ensuring Faster Image Retrieval and Storage efficiency for JPEG Image


By customizing the Progressive JPEG method, we propose a new Scan Script to ensure Faster Image Retrieval. Furthermore, we also propose a new lossy PJPEG architecture to reduce the file size as a solution to overcome our Scan Script’s drawback. We evaluate our proposed orchestration in a real-world setting across two continents encompassing a private cloud. Compared to existing alternatives, our proposed orchestration can improve user waiting time by up to 54% and decrease image size by up to 27%. Our proposed work is tested in cutting-edge cloud apps, ensuring up to 69% quicker loading time.

Used Tools: Ffmpeg · OpenStack · CentOS

## Project: Tackling Sexual Harassment on Public Transport with Deep Neural Network

Its an ongoing personal project. In Bangladesh, sexual harassment is a big issue, despite
police efforts to safeguard victims. I use object detection to determine the interest area and detect car license plates from photos. Later, I transform the cropped photo to text using the observed area by using DNN based tools. This can be utilized to combat sexual harassment on public transportation in Bangladesh, as transmitting the vehicle’s SMS to authorities will be much easier. For starter, I use a pre-existing kaggle dataset, ”Car License Plate Detection” which has 433 photos of various vehicles with various sorts of license plates. By Using Tensorflow train the region of interest, these trained images know what I’m seeking for. Then I use Pytorch’s EasyOCR for the OPR. EasyOCR detected
the characters and converted them to text using the reader API. Now I am trying to build a dataset from Bangladeshi vehicle templates.
