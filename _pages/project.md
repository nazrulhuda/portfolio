## Project: [BRACU-ResearcherHub](https://github.com/nazrulhuda/BRACU-ResearcherHub)

Social media for BRAC University researchers to find collaborators. Researchers can create separate research labs within specific research areas. If other researchers find the lab interesting; they can join and comment on the lab. An efficient way to find the next research collaborator.

Used tools: Django · Django REST Framework · PostgreSQL · SQLite


## Project: [Devising a Faster Video Streaming Architecture using Low Bandwidth Video Compression Techniques](https://github.com/nazrulhuda/video-codec-for-live-streaming)

This project is a part of the Research Proposal. Compared different codecs for live video streaming.

- Used FFmeg’s libx264 for H.264, libx265 for H.265, and libvpx-vp9 for VP9. To compare qualities, used SSIM, PSNR,
and VMAF. 
- Tuned the settings in real-time functionality to imitate live video streaming.This project is a part of the Research Proposal. Compared different codecs for live video streaming.
