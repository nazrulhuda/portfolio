ðŸŽ“ I'm a Graduate Research Assistant and a fully funded MS in Computer Science student at Oklahoma State University, maintaining a perfect GPA of 4.0/4.0. 

ðŸ’¼ With over 11 months of experience as a Junior Software Engineer at Tirzok Private Ltd., I am specialized in backend development. My work ranged from developing AI solutions and integrating AWS services to building backend systems using clients' preferred frameworks and databases.

ðŸ“š I also have over two years of experience as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at BRAC University, where I honed my skills in data collection and analysis.

# Selected Experience

## Automatic Document Validation with Textract

For a US-based borrowing company [Kramasoft](https://kramasoft.com/landing), I implemented automatic validation for borrower documents by developing machine learning classifiers to identify document types, enhancing the systemâ€™s verification process. I engineered a specialized document trimmer that uses advanced ML classifiers to intelligently remove irrelevant pages, sending only important pages to AWS Textract for precise data extraction. I developed robust extraction processes to retrieve crucial field values accurately and built RESTful APIs using Spring Boot and PostgreSQL to facilitate auto-validation processes. Additionally, I integrated AmazonMQ (RabbitMQ) for seamless internal communication and deployed the system in AWS Lambda using ECR. 

## Bridging the Digital Divide: A Study of HVECs in Southeast Bandarban
In the high mountains of southeast Bandarban, highly vulnerable ethnic communities (HVECs) live without basic mobile and network availability. To address the digital divide among HVECs, we conducted a mixed-method study involving two visits to six different ethnic communities across 15 villages. Trekking for nine days to collect data, we engaged 72 participants in quantitative and qualitative research, using statistical and machine learning methods. Our findings revealed that 34.2% of participants had never used the Internet, and only 13.7% used it once a week. We explored their Internet skills, outcomes, and reasons for limited use, providing insights to narrow the physical access divide and inform future HCI4D design. This study contributes to understanding the digital divide and technology design for distant indigenous communities, broadening the scope of the HCI4D/ICT4D community.

## Developing the Backend of Janatar Sarkar

I developed RESTful APIs for the backend of the [Janatar Sarkar](https://janatarsarkar.gov.bd/) government-public interaction website using Node.js and MongoDB. I also implemented a comprehensive Role Management System utilizing JWT authentication, Node.js, and MongoDB. This system ensures secure access control tailored to various types of administrators within janatarsarkar, allowing precise assignment of roles and responsibilities
