🎓 I'm a Graduate Research Assistant at Oklahoma State University. Recently, I am working on the **NASA HOME STRI project** with [Dr. Ramanan](https://ceat.okstate.edu/iem/people/ramanan-faculty-profile.html), where I am developing an AI-agent orchestration framework with LangChain, MCP, and Gustavo for IoT, including privacy-preserving verification using zero-knowledge proofs. Previously, I built a dataset of 1.2M+ Istio/Envoy logs and trained ML models (92% accuracy) to detect DDoS attacks, engineering a self-protective service mesh that reroutes traffic away from compromised services with [Dr. Jahan]([https://experts.okstate.edu/sharmin.jahan).


💼 With over 11 months of experience as a Junior Software Engineer at Tirzok Private Ltd., I am specialized in backend development. My work ranged from developing AI solutions and integrating AWS services to building backend systems using clients' preferred frameworks and databases.


📚 I also have over two years of experience as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at BRAC University, where I honed my skills in data collection and analysis.

🔍Currently, I am actively seeking jobs starting from Summer 2026. My interest in research and technology grew under the mentorship of Dr. Jannatun Noor, who taught me to be flexible and adapt to emerging technologies every day. I am excited to bring my background in software engineering, infused with AI expertise and research experience to innovative teams where I can contribute, learn, and grow.

# Selected Experience

## Automatic Document Validation with Textract

For a US-based borrowing company [Kramasoft](https://kramasoft.com/landing), I implemented automatic validation for borrower documents by developing machine learning classifiers to identify document types, enhancing the system’s verification process. I engineered a specialized document trimmer that uses advanced ML classifiers to intelligently remove irrelevant pages, sending only important pages to AWS Textract for precise data extraction. I developed robust extraction processes to retrieve crucial field values accurately and built RESTful APIs using Spring Boot and PostgreSQL to facilitate auto-validation processes. Additionally, I integrated AmazonMQ (RabbitMQ) for seamless internal communication and deployed the system in AWS Lambda using ECR. 

## Bridging the Digital Divide: A Study of HVECs in Southeast Bandarban
In the high mountains of southeast Bandarban, highly vulnerable ethnic communities (HVECs) live without basic mobile and network availability. To address the digital divide among HVECs, we conducted a mixed-method study involving two visits ![Illustration of combining vision and language modalities](images/o.jpg){: .align-left width="300px"} to six different ethnic communities across 15 villages. Trekking for nine days to collect data, we engaged 72 participants in quantitative and qualitative research, using statistical and machine learning methods. Our findings revealed that 34.2% of participants had never used the Internet, and only 13.7% used it once a week. We explored their Internet skills, outcomes, and reasons for limited use, providing insights to narrow the physical access divide and inform future HCI4D design. This study contributes to understanding the digital divide and technology design for distant indigenous communities, broadening the scope of the HCI4D/ICT4D community.

## Developing the Backend of Janatar Sarkar

I developed RESTful APIs for the backend of the [Janatar Sarkar](https://janatarsarkar.gov.bd/) government-public interaction website using Node.js and MongoDB. I also implemented a comprehensive Role Management System utilizing JWT authentication, Node.js, and MongoDB. This system ensures secure access control tailored to various types of administrators within janatarsarkar, allowing precise assignment of roles and responsibilities
