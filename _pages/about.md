ðŸŽ“ I'm a Graduate Research Assistant and a fully funded MS in Computer Science student at Oklahoma State University, maintaining a perfect GPA of 4.0/4.0. 

ðŸ’¼ With over 11 months of experience as a Junior Software Engineer at Tirzok Private Ltd., I am specialized in backend development. My work ranged from developing AI solutions and integrating AWS services to building backend systems using clients' preferred frameworks and databases.

ðŸ“š I also have over two years of experience as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at BRAC University, where I honed my skills in data collection and analysis.
