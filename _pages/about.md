ðŸŽ“ I'm a Graduate Research Assistant and a fully funded MS in Computer Science student at Oklahoma State University, maintaining a perfect GPA of 4.0/4.0. 

ðŸ’¼ With over 11 months of experience as a Junior Software Engineer at Tirzok Private Ltd., I am specialized in backend development. My work ranged from developing AI solutions and integrating AWS services to building backend systems using clients' preferred frameworks and databases.

ðŸ“š I also have over two years of experience as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at BRAC University, where I honed my skills in data collection and analysis.

#Selected Experience

##Automatic Document Validation

For a US-based borrowing company, I implemented automatic validation for borrower documents by developing machine learning classifiers to identify document types, enhancing the systemâ€™s verification process. I engineered a specialized document trimmer that uses advanced ML classifiers to intelligently remove irrelevant pages, sending only important pages to AWS Textract for precise data extraction. I developed robust extraction processes to retrieve crucial field values accurately and built RESTful APIs using Spring Boot and PostgreSQL to facilitate auto-validation processes. Additionally, I integrated AmazonMQ (RabbitMQ) for seamless internal communication and deployed the system in AWS Lambda using ECR.
