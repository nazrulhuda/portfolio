# [Orchestrating Image Retrieval and Storage Over a Cloud System](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9743811/authors##authors)

**Published in:** *IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing ( Volume: 11, Issue: 2, 01 April-June 2023)*
[Q1, Impact Factor: 5.938] 

Since massive numbers of images are now being communicated from, and stored in different cloud systems, faster retrieval has become extremely important. This is more relevant, especially after COVID-19 in bandwidth-constrained environments. However, to the best of our knowledge, a coherent solution to overcome this problem is yet to be investigated in the literature. In this article, by customizing the Progressive JPEG method, we propose a new Scan Script to ensure Faster Image Retrieval. Furthermore, we also propose a new lossy PJPEG architecture to reduce the file size as a solution to overcome our Scan Script's drawback. In order to achieve an orchestration between them, we improve the scanning of Progressive JPEG's picture payloads to ensure Faster Image Retrieval using the change in bit pixels of distinct Luma and Chroma components ( Y , Cb , and Cr ). The orchestration improves user experience even in bandwidth-constrained cases. We evaluate our proposed orchestration in a real-world setting across two continents encompassing a private cloud. Compared to existing alternatives, our proposed orchestration can improve user waiting time by up to 54% and decrease image size by up to 27%. Our proposed work is tested in cutting-edge cloud apps, ensuring up to 69% quicker loading time.

# [Mitigating DDoS Attacks Using a Resource Sharing Network](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3569551.3569560)

**Published in:** *2022 9th International Conference on Networking, Systems and Security (NSysS)*

Cloud computing has gained noticeable popularity due to its ability to radically improve computing power through the application of virtual machines. In this era of the internet, however, security threats are increasing and it is costing many businesses. The seemingly legitimate traffic of these application-level attacks renders the previous detection and mitigation methods ineffective. These cyber-attacks have grown ever so sophisticated and the detection and mitigation of these attacks has become one of the major concerns of security researchers and cloud service providers all around the globe. In this paper, we propose a resource sharing method to create a universal solution to mitigate DDoS attacks. We use an existing filtering method to track the IP addresses of attackers, then send them to the proxy server and delete unwanted IP packet requests by memory management system. Later, we emulate the blockchain network using 50 Nginx VM servers as a start to show the potential of our proposal. We show that our method can mitigate 66% of attacks with only 50VMs. To maximize the capability of mitigating DDoS attacks of our network, we need to increase the number of VM’s and it may take at least a few dozen developers working years on end to develop. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to lay the foundation on which one day the universal solution will be created.

# [Darkness under The Lamp: Physical Access Divide And Its Consequences among The Little-Known Indigenous Communities in Bangladesh](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1du3GCWL3Qdkvn4oCvuEXCmyPL9dvU5ev/view?usp=sharing)

**[In Review]:** *[Nominated for the second round (top 48.1%) in CHI ’23; received notification on November 8, 2022]*

In the high mountains of southeast Bandarban, highly vulnerable ethnic communities (we refer to them as HVECs) live without basic mobile and network availability. To the best of our knowledge, no study in the literature has focused on the digital divide scenarios of HVECs. To create a new discussion in HCI, we make two visits to six different ethnic communities in 15 different paras (villages) and conduct a mixed-method study to uncover their mobile and network availability with HVECs. We share our field experiences with the CSCW communities that we used to tackle the non-availability of local informers and interpreters in HVECs. Moreover, we discuss the insights of HVECs of ‘narrowing the physical access divide’ (specifically technology inclusion) to aid future HCI4D design. This study will help researchers better prepare for fieldwork and design technologies in distant indigenous communities.

# [Leveraging Pre-Primary Education of Indigenous Communities in Bangladesh through Participatory and Iterative Development of Online Resources](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1du3GCWL3Qdkvn4oCvuEXCmyPL9dvU5ev/view)

**[In Review]:** *[Information Technology for Development]*

Bangladesh's indigenous children are struggling to adapt to the country's educational system. As a result, a significant portion of indigenous children is dropping out of school. In order to determine why indigenous people are lagging behind mainstream populations in terms of education, we interview a total of 140 participants who are involved with indigenous primary education in the Chittagong hill Tracts of Bangladesh. Our findings show that for indigenous children, language barriers are the main obstacle towards obtaining a quality education. To seek a remedy, we make multiple visits and interact with people involved with indigenous education. We observe that a website with educational materials in indigenous languages can assist indigenous children to receive a high-quality education. However, designing a website in this context is a critical task, as most people are outside of digital connectivity. For remedy, we bring a new perspective on how local intermediaries can directly support indigenous children to access internet. Through Iterative Participatory Design, in this paper, we design an educational website called IPE (Indigenous Primary Education) using online resources. Also, we explain that local primary school teachers and the local bengali people can guarantee that indigenous students have access to IPE. The IPE website, designed with local input and addressing the specific needs of the indigenous population in CHT, offers a new approach to supporting vulnerable children's education in the global south.

# [Towards Devising a Fund Management System Using Blockchain](https://aircconline.com/csit/papers/vol12/csit121820.pdf)

**Published in:** *International Journal of Computer Science & Information Technology (IJCSIT), 12 (18), 225-238.*

State government operations comprise a large number of transactions for different processes that must be carried out across the state. This comprises new projects, maintenance and repairs, public employee compensation, and agricultural schemes. Low-level corruption, which is sometimes difficult to trace and hinders state growth, is a big challenge for the top administration. In order to eradicate corruption and bring transparency, technology can be used in an efficient way. An important task to exterminate corruption is to keep track of all the financial transactions of an undergoing project. This research uses blockchain technology to keep track of fund management systems and assure the transparency of any financial statement. This paper proposes to use a gateway where all transaction records are updated in the system and visible to all stakeholders. We find research gaps in the literature and focus on including government funds and local currency usage. The proposed model's motive is to generate a funding model that attains two sub-goals: designing a fund management methodology in which authorized individuals can receive and withdraw allocated funds in crypto currency, and evaluating a smart contract to incorporate the money and identify transparency and tracking. The proposed model executes every feature of our system in just 8.3786ms on average
