title: "Darkness under The Lamp: Physical Access Divide And Its Consequences among The Little-Known Indigenous Communities in Bangladesh"
collection: publications
date: 2024
excerpt: 'In the high mountains of southeast Bandarban, highly vulnerable ethnic communities (we refer to them as HVECs) live without basic mobile and network availability. To the best of our knowledge, no study in the literature has focused on the digital divide scenarios of HVECs. To create a new discussion in HCI, we make two visits to six different ethnic communities in 15 different paras (villages) and conduct a mixed-method study to uncover their mobile and network availability with HVECs. We share our field experiences with the CSCW communities that we used to tackle the non-availability of local informers and interpreters in HVECs. Moreover, we discuss the insights of HVECs of ‘narrowing the physical access divide’ (specifically technology inclusion) to aid future HCI4D design. This study will help researchers better prepare for fieldwork and design technologies in distant indigenous communities.'
