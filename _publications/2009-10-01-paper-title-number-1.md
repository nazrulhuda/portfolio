excerpt: 'In the high mountains of southeast Bandarban, highly vulnerable ethnic communities (we refer to them as HVECs) live without basic mobile and network availability. To the best of our knowledge, no study in the literature has focused on improving HVECs life. To create a new discussion in HCI, we make two visits to six different ethnic communities in 15 different paras (villages) and conduct a mixed-method study to uncover their mobile and network availability with HVECs. We share the framework we used to tackle the non-availability of local informers and interpreters in HVECs. This study will help researchers better prepare for fieldwork and design technologies in distant indigenous communities'
